# Procredural Paintings

`Paintings are nice. Am i right?`

I cannot draw. Like, at all. I always wanted to draw but I always failed to, sadly. There's something about pencils and canvases and brushes that... scares me. The most complex thing I can draw is a stickman, probably. Without shadows, because they are too hard.

But there's something I can do (pretty well, if I say so myself): coding.

So I put together something that could draw abstract "paintings" *(the quotes are there to avoid being too pretentious)* by using some good ol' HTML5 and Perlin Noise.

This might (I could aswell say **will**) slow down your PC and likely won't work on mobile devices.

To generate a new canvas, `CLICK` (or `tap`, if you are unlyucky enough to be trying this from your mobile) on it. If you see a canvas that you like, press `ENTER` to save it (sorry, mobile users).

Each canvas is numered as it's unique.
